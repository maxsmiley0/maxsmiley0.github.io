	<h1>Mechanics</h1>
</div>

<p>Kinematics is how we describe motion with displacement, velocity, and acceleration. It is incredibly useful, as we can perfectly calculate the outcome of an event regarding motion. For example, we can calculate how long it will take a ball to fall down a certain distance. Or, we can calculate how far something will go given an initial velocity. In the kinematic equations, every equation uses the vector forms of quantities, rather than their scalar forms. The following chart is a quick reminder of the differences.

<h2>The Kinematic Equations</span></h2>

<p>
	The kinematic equations relate acceleration, velocity, displacement, and time together. If you know enough of these quantities, you can figure out the rest. For example, if you look at the first equation in the chart, it relates final velocity, initial velocity, acceleration, and time. So, if you knew all of those quantities except for time, you would use that equation to solve for time.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>In any given kinematics problem, you should follow these steps.

<ul><span style="color:#FF0000;">1. Isolate the variables given<br /><br />
	2. Determine the variable you need to find<br /><br />
	3. Use the equation that relates the given variables to the variable you need to find<br /><br />
	4. Plug in numbers, and solve<br />

</ul>

<p>Let's say you roll a ball down a slightly slanted hill. It starts at rest, but due to gravity, the acceleration is 3 meters per second in the direction of motion. If you wanted to find after how much time the ball would be rolling at 15 meters per second, you would use a kinematic equation.

<ul><span style="color:#008800;">1. The variables given are <span style ="color:#FF0000;">acceleration, initial velocity, and final velocity</span>. The problem says that the ball starts at rest, which means its <span style ="color:#FF0000;">initial velocity is 0 meters per second</span><br /><br />
	2. The question asks for <span style ="color:#FF0000;">time</span>, so you are solving for variable <span style ="color:#FF0000;">"t".</span><br /><br />
	3. The first kinematic equation is the only one that relates <span style ="color:#FF0000;">initial velocity, final velocity, acceleration</span>, and <span style ="color:#FF0000;">time</span> all together.<br /><br />
	4. Plugging in <span style ="color:#FF0000;">vf = 15, vi = 0, and a = 3, </span>gives you <span style ="color:#000000;">t = 5s.</span><br />

</ul></p>

<h2>Freefall problems</h2>

<p>Freefall problems have to do with an object's motion, where the only force is gravity. For example, throwing a ball straight up or down would be a freefall problem. Rolling a ball on a horizontal surface would not be a freefall problem. The key in freefall problems, is that gravity will accelerate the object downwards at 9.8 meters per second squared. Because of this, we can use <span style ="color:#FF0000;">a = -9.8</span>, just by knowing that its a freefall problem. The sign is negative, because upwards is usually defined to be the positive direction.

<p>Let's say we throw a ball upwards with an initial velocity of 15 meters per second. How far will it be displaced in 3 seconds?

<ul><span style="color:#008800;">1. The variables given are <span style ="color:#FF0000;">acceleration, initial velocity, and time</span>. This is a freefall problem, which means the <span style ="color:#FF0000;">acceleration is -9.8 meters per second squared.</span><br /><br />
	2. The question asks for <span style ="color:#FF0000;">displacement</span>, so you are solving for variable <span style ="color:#FF0000;">"d".</span><br /><br />
	3. The third kinematic equation is the only one that relates <span style ="color:#FF0000;">initial velocity, time, acceleration</span>, and <span style ="color:#FF0000;">displacement</span> all together.<br /><br />
	4. Plugging in <span style ="color:#FF0000;">vi = 15, t = 3, and a = -9.8, </span>gives you <span style ="color:#000000;">d = .9 meters</span><br />

</ul></p>

<p>Since the displacement is so close to zero, we can assume that the ball went upwards, and was on its way down after 3 seconds. It wouldn't make sense for the ball to have traveled less than a meter upwards after throwing it up at 15 meters per second.

<ul><i><b>8. (Challenge)</b></i> Two cars line up for a race. The gun goes off, and one shoots off from the start with an initial speed of 20 meters per second. The other car starts at rest, but accelerates slowly, at a steady 2 meters per second. How long (in seconds) will it take for the accelerating car to pass the nonaccelerating car? How far away from the starting point will this happen?</ul>


<h3>Practice Answers</h3>

<ul>1. <br />
	<b>Both will hit the ground with the same final velocity<br /></b>
	To verify this, we can plug in arbitrary variables to the kinematic equations. We have the displacement (d), initial velocity (positive and negative v), and since this is a freefall problem, we know each ball has the same acceleration (a = -9.8). We're trying to find final velocity, so we need to find an equation that relates displacement, initial and final velocity, and acceleration. The fourth kinematic equation satisfies this parameter. You'll notice that the initial velocity term is squared, which cancels out the negative sign, verifying that a positive or negative initial velocity will yield the same result.
</ul>
<ul>2. <br />
	<b>Upwards: negative acceleration<br />
	Peak: negative acceleration<br />
	Downwards: negative acceleration<br /></b>
	At every point in time, a ball in freefall will be accelerating downwards, or negatively. On its way up, its speed is decreasing, meaning that the acceleration acts in the opposite direction of the motion. On the way down, the speed is increasing, which means that the acceleration acts in the same direction of the motion. Its a bit trickier to conceptualize when the ball is at its peak, but remember that an object with zero velocity can have nonzero acceleration. Even though it is not moving at that point in time, its velocity will be negative in the next instance, so it <i>does</i> have a change in velocity (which is an acceleration).

	3. The second kinematic equation is the only one that relates <span style ="color:#FF0000;">initial velocity, final velocity, acceleration</span>, and <span style ="color:#FF0000;">displacement</span> all together.<br /><br />
	4. Plugging in <span style ="color:#FF0000;">vi = 6, vf = 8, and t = 2, </span>gives you <span style ="color:#000000;">d = 18 meters</span><br />
</ul>

<ul>8. <br />
	<b>Time: 20 seconds<br /></b>
	<b>Displacement: 400 meters</b><br />
	This is a bit harder to solve, so let's draw a schematic diagram to orient ourselves to the problem. We know that the first car (the one not accelerating) will have a final velocity of 20 meters per second, as it does not accelerate. We do not know the final velocity of the accelerating car.
</ul>

<ul>
	We don't know the time or displacement, but we know that the time of car one will be the same as the time for car two, and likewise for displacement. This is implied, since the question asks us when they overlap. Technically, we now have four known variables: initial velocity, acceleration, displacement, and time. If we look for a kinematic equation that contains these four variables, we see that equation #3 fulfills this requirement. Now, we will make two seperate equations, one for each car, and solve.
