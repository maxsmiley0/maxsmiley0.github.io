	<h1>Mechanics</h1>
</div>

<p>We've established the difference between <span style="color:#FF0000;">vectors</span> and <span style="color:#009900;">scalars</span>. However, there are other <span style="color:#FF0000;">vectors</span> and <span style="color:#009900;">scalars</span> besides <span style="color:#FF0000;">displacement</span> and <span style="color:#009900;">distance</span>. Two must-know's in physics are <span style="color:#009900;">speed</span> and <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span>. As you know, <span style="color:#009900;">speed</span> is the rate at which <span style="color:#009900;">distance</span> changes with respect to time. You may have heard the term <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span>, but not have known the difference between <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span> and <span style="color:#009900;">speed</span>. <span style="color:#FF0000;">Velocity</span> is how <span style="color:#FF0000;">displacement</span> changes with respect to time.
</div>

<h2><span style="color:#009900;">Speed</span> vs. <span style="color:#FF0000;">Velocity</span></h2>

<p>Let's say you walk forward 10 meters, then walk backwards 6 meters. It takes you 8 seconds to do this. We know that the <span style="color:#009900;">distance</span> traveled is 16 meters, and the <span style="color:#FF0000;">displacement</span> is 4 meters. If we want to find the <span style="color:#009900;">speed</span> and <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span>, we divide the <span style="color:#009900;">distance</span> by time, or the <span style="color:#FF0000;">displacement</span> by time, respectively. Both <span style="color:#009900;">speed</span> and <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span> use the unit meters per second, or m/s.</p>

<h2>Positives and Negative Values for <span style="color:#FF0000;">Velocity</span></h2>

<p>Since <span style="color:#FF0000;">vector</span> values have direction, they can be positive or negative. Since <span style="color:#009900;">speed</span> only represents magnitude, it can only be positive. What is negative and what is positive depends on which way you define positive and negative. The <i>convention</i> in physics is that up, north, east, right, and forward are all defined as positive. Likewise, down, south, west, left, and backwards are all defined as negative. This holds true for <span style="color:#FF0000;">displacement</span> as well. 

<img src="images/svv3.png">

<p>In the scenario above, the ball travels 6 meters to the right, and then 10 meters to the left. Since right is defined as positive by convention, the <span style="color:#FF0000;">displacement</span> is -4 meters. Therefore, the <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span> is -.5 meters. </p>

<div id = "blurb">
<p><i>This interactive program allows you to see the relationship between <span style="color:#009900;">speed</span> and <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span>. Click on the window, and use the arrow keys to move the circle around. Press start, and a clock will count out 10 seconds. At the top, you will see the average <span style="color:#009900;">speed</span> and <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span> attained over 10 seconds, as well as the <span style="color:#009900;">distance</span> and <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span> from the origin.</i></p>

<p><i>Notice how at any point in time, the average <span style="color:#009900;">speed</span> is the <span style="color:#009900;">distance</span> divided by time, and the average <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span> is the <span style="color:#FF0000;">displacement</span> divided by time. This can most easily be seen at the end of 10 seconds.</i></p>

<ul><i><b>10. (Challenge)</b></i> A rowdy teenager drives 20 meters forwards. In a display of his car's reversing capabilities, he suddenly speeds backwards 50 meters. At the end of his stunt, if the difference between the average velocity and average speed is 80 meters per second, what is his average speed and velocity, and how long does the stunt last?</ul>


<h3>Practice Answers</h3>

<ul>1. <br />
	<b>Speed: 5 meters per second<br />
	Velocity: -5 meters per second<br /></b>
	It travels 5 meters, so that is its distance. It falls down 5 meters, so the displacement is -5 meters by convention. To find the speed and velocity, divide the distance and displacement by time, respectively.
</ul>
<ul>2. <br />
	<b>Speed: 10 meters per second<br />
	Velocity: -3.33 meters per second<br /></b>
	First find the distance and displacement. The distance is 120 meters, while the displacement is -40 meters. Then divide both by 12 seconds, to get average speed and velocity.
</ul>
<img src="images/svv4.png">
<ul>3. <br />
	<b>Time: 1 second<br />
	Velocity: 0 meters per second<br /></b>
	The athlete jumps up to two meters, so by the time she lands, she has traveled 4 meters. We want to solve for time, and we know speed and distance. Since speed is distance over time, time is distance over speed. Dividing 4 by 4 gives us one second. Since the athlete ends up where she started, her displacement is 0, and therefore her velocity is zero.
</ul>
<img src="images/svv5.png">
<ul>4. <br />
	<b>It is not possible</b><br />
	If the ball is to the left of the starting point, this means negative displacement. Since velocity is displacement over time, it is impossible for the velocity to be positive if the displacement is negative.
</ul>
<ul>5. <br />
	<b>It is possible</b><br />
	The instantaneous velocity is a measure of the velocity at a single instance in time. If the ball is traveling to the right, then its instantaneous velocity is positive.
</ul>
<ul>6. <br />
	<b>False</b><br />
	Speed is always positive, even when the velocity is negative. Therefore, knowing the speed tells us nothing about the sign of the velocity.
</ul>

<ul>7. <br />
	<b>True</b><br />
	If the velocity is positive, that means the displacement is positive. If the displacement is positive, that means the distance is positive. Therefore, the speed is positive, because speed shares the same sign as distance, just as average velocity always shares the same sign as average displacement.
</ul>
<ul>8. <br />
	<b>True</b><br />
	If the speed is zero, the distance is zero. Therefore, the displacement is zero. Since the displacement is zero, the velocity is zero.
</ul>
<ul>9. <br />
	<b>False</b><br />
	If the velocity is zero, the displacement is zero. However, the distance can still be nonzero. One example is if you walk forward one meter, then back one meter. Your displacement is 0 meters, but your distance is 2 meters. Since the distance could be nonzero, the speed could be nonzero.
</ul>
<ul>10. <br />
	<b>Average Speed: 56 meters per second<br />
	Average Velocity: -24 meters per second<br />
	Time: 1.25 seoncds</b><br />
	Start by drawing the scenario. From the prompt, we automatically know the distance and displacement.
</ul>
<img src="images/svv6.png">
<ul>
	The prompt tells us that the difference between average speed and velocity is 80. Speed is always greater or equal to velocity, so in this scenario speed must be 80 meters per second greater than the velocity. We can represent this with variables: let <b>x</b> be velocity, and <b>x + 80</b> be speed.
</ul>
<img src="images/svv7.png">
<ul>
	We know that speed is distance over time. We also know that velocity is displacement over time. Since we have variables for most of these criteria, we can write out equations for it. 
</ul>
<img src="images/svv8.png">
<ul>
	Notice that there's a common variable, time. Solve for time, then we can set both equations equal to each other.
</ul>
<img src="images/svv9.png">
<ul>
	x represents velocity. Therefore the average velocity is -24 meters per second. The speed is the velocity plus 80 meters per second, so the speed is 56 meters per second. To find the time, we can either divide the distance by the speed, or the velocity by the displacement. Both calculations give you 1.25 seconds.
