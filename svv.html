	<h1>Kinematics</h1>
</div>

<p>We've established the difference between <span style="color:#FF0000;">vectors</span> and <span style="color:#009900;">scalars</span>. However, there are other <span style="color:#FF0000;">vectors</span> and <span style="color:#009900;">scalars</span> besides <span style="color:#FF0000;">displacement</span> and <span style="color:#009900;">distance</span>. Two must-know's in physics are <span style="color:#009900;">speed</span> and <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span>. As you know, <span style="color:#009900;">speed</span> is the rate as which <span style="color:#009900;">distance</span> changes with respect to time. You may have heard the term <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span>, but not have known the difference between <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span> and <span style="color:#009900;">speed</span>. <span style="color:#FF0000;">Velocity</span> is how <span style="color:#FF0000;">displacement</span> changes with respect to time.
</div>

<h2><span style="color:#009900;">Speed</span> vs. <span style="color:#FF0000;">Velocity</span></h2>

<p>Let's say you walk forward 10 meters, then walk backwards 6 meters. It takes you 8 seconds to do this. We know that the <span style="color:#009900;">distance</span> traveled is 16 meters, and the <span style="color:#FF0000;">displacement</span> is 4 meters. If we want to find the <span style="color:#009900;">speed</span> and <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span>, we divide the <span style="color:#009900;">distance</span> by time, or the <span style="color:#FF0000;">displacement</span> by time, respectively. Both <span style="color:#009900;">speed</span> and <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span> use the unit meters per second, or m/s.</p>

<h2>Positives and Negative Values for <span style="color:#FF0000;">Velocity</span></h2>

<p>Since <span style="color:#FF0000;">vector</span> values have direction, they can be positive or negative. Since <span style="color:#009900;">speed</span> only represents magnitude, it can only be positive. What is negative and what is positive depends on which way you define positive and negative. The <i>convention</i> in physics is that up, north, east, right, and forward are all defined as positive. Likewise, down, south, west, left, and backwards are all defined as negative. This holds true for <span style="color:#FF0000;">displacement</span> as well. 

<img src="images/svv3.png">

<p>In the scenario above, the ball travels 6 meters to the right, and then 10 meters to the left. Since right is defined as positive by convention, the <span style="color:#FF0000;">displacement</span> is -4 meters. Therefore, the <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span> is -.5 meters. </p>

<div id = "blurb">
<p><i>This interactive program allows you to see the relationship between <span style="color:#009900;">speed</span> and <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span>. Click on the window, and use the arrow keys to move the circle around. Press start, and a clock will count out 10 seconds. At the top, you will see the average <span style="color:#009900;">speed</span> and <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span> attained over 10 seconds, as well as the <span style="color:#009900;">distance</span> and <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span> from the origin.</i></p>

<div id = "blurb">
<p><i>Notice how at any point in time, the average <span style="color:#009900;">speed</span> is the <span style="color:#009900;">distance</span> divided by time, and the average <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span> is the <span style="color:#FF0000;">displacement</span> divided by time. This can most easily be seen at the end of 10 seconds.</i></p>

<ul><i><b>10. (Challenge)</b></i> A rowdy teenager drives 20 meters to the right. In a display of his car's reversing capabilities, he suddenly speeds backwords 50 meters. At the end of his stint, if the difference between the average velocity and average speed is 80 meters per second, what is his average speed and velocity, and how long does the stint last?</ul>


<h3>Practice Answers</h3>

<ul>1. <br />
	<b>Speed: 5 meters per second<br />
	Velocity: -5 meters per second<br /></b>
	It travels 5 meters, so that is its distance. It falls down 5 meters, so the displacement is -5 meters by convention. To find the speed and velocity, divide the distance and displacement by time, respectively.
</ul>
<ul>2. <br />
	<b>Speed: 10 meters per second<br />
	Velocity: -3.33 meters per second<br /></b>
	First find the distance and displacement. The distance is 120 meters, while the displacement is -40 meters. Then divide both by 12 seconds, to get average speed and velocity.
</ul>

<ul>3. <br />
	<b>Time: 1 second<br />
	Velocity: 0 meters per second<br /></b>
	The athlete jump up to two meters, so by the time he lands, he has traveled 4 meters. We want to solve for time, and we know speed and distance. Since speed is distance over time, time is distance over speed. Dividing 4 by 4 gives us one second. Since the athlete ends up where he started, his displacement is 0, and therefore his velocity is zero.
</ul>
<img src="images/svv5.png">
<ul>4. <br />
	<b>Distance: 70 meters<br />
	Displacement: 50 meters<br /></b>
	The boy travels 40 meters, then 30 meters. Therefore, the distance is 70 meters. However, he turns at a 90 degree angle. You can find the total displacement by drawing a right angle and solving for the hypotenuse.
</ul>
<img src="images/kp4.png">
<ul>5. <br />
	<b>Distance: 3 meters<br />
	Displacement: 1 meters<br /></b>
	It falls for two meters, then bounces up for one meter before caught. Therefore, the distance is 3 meters. However, the ball rises for one meter in the opposite direction that it fell in, so its displacement is 3 - 1 = 2 meters.
</ul>
<img src="images/kp5.png">
<ul>6. <br />
	<b>Distance: Infinite<br />
	Displacement: 326 units<br /></b>
	There is no limit to the distance. If you move back and forth, the distance traveled will just keep on rising. However, the ball cannot move outside of the screen. This limits the distance between the ball and the origin. The farthest possible distance away from the center can be found in any of the four corners, which will give you the number "326".
</ul>

<ul>7. <br />
	<b>Distance: 15 kilometers<br />
	Displacement: 14.55 kilometers<br /></b>
	It travels 10 km, then 5 km. Therefore, its distance is 15 km. For its displacement, we have to take the 30 degrees into consideration. Draw a triangle where one leg is 10 km, and another is 5 km. The angle between them should be 150 degrees, because 30 degrees off course means 30 degrees from a 180 degree angle. Then use the law of cosines to solve for the final side, which is displacement.
