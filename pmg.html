<p>Last unit, we talked about motion in one direction. Projectile motion is the continuation of kinematics into two dimensions. A common misconception is that the 2 dimensional problems will be twice as hard. This is not the case: they will only be twice as long. You will have to use the kinematic equations twice: once for the horizontal direction, and once for the vertical direction. </p>
</div>

<h2>Components of velocity in two dimensions</h2>

<p>When solving projectile motion properties, you must treat the <span style ="color:#8900D3;">horizontal</span> and <span style ="color:#FF8800;">vertical</span> parts of motion as two seperate entities. For example, lets say you're given that a projectile has an initial velocity of <span style ="color:#FF0000;">50 meters per second, launched at 60 degrees above the horizontal.</span>The first thing you should do is break this up into speed in the <span style ="color:#8900D3;">x direction</span>, and speed in the <span style ="color:#FF8800;">y direction</span>. You can do this with trigonometry; to find the speed in the <span style ="color:#8900D3;">x direction</span>, multiply the overall velocity by the <span style ="color:#8900D3;">cosine</span> of the angle. To find the speed in the <span style ="color:#FF8800;">y direction</span>, multiply the overall velocity by the <span style ="color:#FF8800;">sine</span> of the angle.</p>

<p>We know that because of gravity, the velocity in the <span style ="color:#FF8800;">y direction</span> will decrease by 9.8 meters per second, every second. However, the velocity in the <span style ="color:#8900D3;">x direction</span> will remain constant! This means that if you throw a ball upwards and forwards, its speed in the <span style ="color:#8900D3;">horizontal</span> direction will be the same at any point in time, even though its <span style ="color:#FF8800;">vertical</span> speed will be constantly changing.</p>

<p>The following picture shows the <span style ="color:#8900D3;">horizontal</span> and <span style ="color:#FF8800;">vertical</span> velocity of a projectile change after each second.

<h2>Logic behind projectile motion problems</span></h2>

<p>In projectile motion problems, there are a lot of implicits. None of these will be mentioned, but it is safe to assume that these rules will alwyas hold up. For example, the acceleration in the <span style ="color:#FF8800;">vertical</span> direction will be -9.8. Also, since the speed is constant in the <span style ="color:#8900D3;">horizontal</span> direction, the acceleration in the <span style ="color:#8900D3;">horizontal</span> direction will be zero. You will often have to deduce more information from the prompt. For example, if a question asks how far a projectile will have traveled <span style ="color:#8900D3;">horizontally</span> when at the peak of its trajectory, you can assume the final velocity in the <span style ="color:#FF8800;">vertical</span> direction is zero, as that is when a projectile is at its peak. You would first solve for time, because time is the only variable that relates the <span style ="color:#8900D3;">horizontal</span> and <span style ="color:#FF8800;">vertical</span> components together. Once you have time, you can find <span style ="color:#8900D3;">horizontal</span> displacement by multiplying time by <span style ="color:#8900D3;">horizontal</span> velocity.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>When solving projectile motion problems, make two equations: one for the <span style ="color:#8900D3;">horizontal</span> direction, and one for the <span style ="color:#FF8800;">vertical</span> direction. For the <span style ="color:#8900D3;">horizontal</span> equation, you will always use the principle that distance is equal to velocity times time. A general rule for solving projectile motion problems follows.

<ul><span style="color:#FF0000;">1. Break down the initial velocity into <span style ="color:#8900D3;">horizontal</span> and <span style ="color:#FF8800;">vertical</span> components, using the sine and cosine.<br /><br />
	2. List the variables we have in the <span style ="color:#FF8800;">vertical</span> direction. For example: acceleration (-9.8 meters per second squared), initial velocity, etc.<br /><br />
	3. Use the equation that relates the given variables to the variable time<br /><br />
	4. If necessary, multiply time by <span style ="color:#8900D3;">horizontal</span> velocity to find <span style ="color:#8900D3;">horizontal</span> displacement. This will not always be necessary, depending on the question.<br />

</ul>

<p>A pitcher throws a ball with an initial velocity of 40 meters per second, 45 degrees up relative to the ground. If the pitcher is two meters tall, how long will it take for the ball to hit the ground. 

<ul><span style="color:#008800;">1. We know that the angle is 45 degrees, and the net initial velocity is 40 meters per second. Therefore, we can break it up into <span style ="color:#8900D3;">horizontal</span> and <span style ="color:#FF8800;">vertical</span> velocity components. Using the equation above, 40 * cos(45) = 28.3 meters per second <span style ="color:#8900D3;">horizontally</span>. Likewise, 40 * sin(45) = 28.3 meters per second <span style ="color:#FF8800;">vertically.</span><br /><br />

<img src="images/pmg4.png">

	2. The variabes we have in the <span style ="color:#FF8800;">vertical</span> direction are <span style ="color:#FF0000;">initial velocity (28.3 meters per second), acceleration (-9.8 meters per second squared), and displacement.</span> The question asks when the ball hits the ground, and since the pitcher is 2 meters tall, this will occur when the ball is displaced negative two meters.<br /><br />
	3. The equation that relates <span style="color:#FF0000;">initial velocity, displacement, acceleration, and time</span> is the third equation. Plugging in the values and solving will give you that time = 5.84 seconds. <br /><br />
	4. Though this question does not ask for it, if you wanted to find <span style ="color:#8900D3;">horizontal</span> displacement (how far it traveled during its path), you would simply multiply the time by the <span style ="color:#8900D3;">horizontal</span> velocity. <span style="color:#FF0000;"> 5.84 x 28.3 = 165.4 meters.</span><br />

</ul></p>

<h2>Quick tips & tricks</h2>

<p>Here are some general rules for projectile motion problems that can cut down on solving time: </p>
<li>If the projectile will land on the same level it was shot at (not off of a cliff or onto a building), you can assume that the vertical displacement is zero.</li><br />
<li>You will almost always use the third kinematic equation when solving for time using the vertical components.</li><br />
<li>If the launch angle is 45 degrees, the horizontal and vertical velocities will equal each other. This is because sin 45 = cos 45</li><br />
<li>It is far simpler to find displacement in the horizontal direction. Since there is no acceleration in the x direction, the only equation you need to remember is that displacement equals velocity times time.</li><br />

<h3>Practice Answers</h3>

<ul>1. <br />
	<b>The vertical velocity degreased with each second. The horizontal velocity stayed constant.<br /></b>
</ul>
<ul>2. <br />
	<b>Parabola<br /></b>
</ul>
<ul>3. <br />
	<b>Horizontal Displacement: 163.4 meters<br /></b><br />
	Split up the velocity into horizontal and vertical components, using the sine and cosine principles.
</ul>
<img src="images/pmg4.png">
<ul>Use the third kinematic equation, where initial velocity is 28.3 meters per second, acceleration is -9.8 meters per second squared, and displacement is 0 meters. You should get time = 5.78 seconds. Multiply this by horizontal velocity (28.3 meters per second), and you get horizontal displacement = 163.4 meters.</ul>
<ul>4. <br />
	<b>Horizontal Displacement: 82.9 meters<br /></b>
	Split up the velocity into horizontal and vertical components, using the sine and cosine principles.
</ul>

<img src="images/pmg5.png">

<ul>
Use the third kinematic equation, where initial velocity is 15 meters per second, acceleration is -9.8 meters per second squared, and displacement is -2 meters. You should get time = 3.19 seconds. Multiply this by horizontal velocity (26 meters per second), and you get horizontal displacement = 82.9 meters.
</ul>
<ul>5. <br />
	<b>Time: 3.52 seconds<br /></b>
	Split up the velocity into horizontal and vertical components, using the sine and cosine principles.
</ul>

<img src="images/pmg6.png">

<ul>
Use the third kinematic equation, where initial velocity is 8.7 meters per second, acceleration is -9.8 meters per second squared, and displacement is -30 meters. You should get time = 3.52 seconds, which is the final answer. The question does not ask you for horizontal displacement.
</ul>
<ul>6. <br />
	<b>45˚ will launch farther<br /></b>
	Though this might seem daunting to start, we can simply start solving this the way we've always solved projectile motion problems. However, this time, we will be using variables instead of real numbers. We will start by breaking down the velocity into components.
</ul>

<img src="images/pmg7.png">
<ul>
	We'll go ahead and use the third kinematic equation, and plug in these variable values for what we'd usually use.
</ul>
<img src="images/pmg8.png">
<ul>
	Notice how each displacement is a variable term, multiplied by a constant term. The v squared is the variable, and all of the sines, cosines, and numbers can be simplified to one number. If we can evaluate the constants and figure out which one is bigger, that displacement will be the greater one. When you do the math for the 30˚ constants, it comes out to be .088. When you do the math for the 45˚ constants, it comes out to be .102. Thus, a 45˚ launch angle will yield a greater launch distance.
