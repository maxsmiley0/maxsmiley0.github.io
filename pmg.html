<p>Last unit, we talked about motion in one direction. Projectile motion is the continuation of kinematics into two dimensions. A common misconception is that the 2 dimensional problems will be twice as hard. This is not the case: they will only be twice as long. You will have to use the kinematic equations twice: once for the horizontal direction, and once for the vertical direction. </p>
</div>

<h2>Components of velocity in two dimensions</h2>

<p>When solving projectile motion properties, you must treat the <span style ="color:#8900D3;">horizontal</span> and <span style ="color:#FF8800;">vertical</span> parts of motion as two seperate entities. For example, lets say you're given that a projectile has an initial velocity of <span style ="color:#FF0000;">50 meters per second, launched at 60 degrees above the horizontal.</span>The first thing you should do is break this up into speed in the <span style ="color:#8900D3;">x direction</span>, and speed in the <span style ="color:#FF8800;">y direction</span>. You can do this with trigonometry; to find the speed in the <span style ="color:#8900D3;">x direction</span>, multiply the overall velocity by the <span style ="color:#8900D3;">cosine</span> of the angle. To find the speed in the <span style ="color:#FF8800;">y direction</span>, multiply the overall velocity by the <span style ="color:#FF8800;">sine</span> of the angle.</p>

<p>We know that because of gravity, the velocity in the <span style ="color:#FF8800;">y direction</span> will decrease by 9.8 meters per second, every second. However, the velocity in the <span style ="color:#8900D3;">x direction</span> will remain constant! This means that if you throw a ball upwards and forwards, its speed in the <span style ="color:#8900D3;">horizontal</span> direction will be the same at any point in time, even though its <span style ="color:#FF8800;">vertical</span> speed will be constantly changing.</p>

<p>The following picture shows the <span style ="color:#8900D3;">horizontal</span> and <span style ="color:#FF8800;">vertical</span> velocity of a projectile change after each second.

<h2>Logic behind projectile motion problems</span></h2>

<p>In projectile motion problems, there are a lot of implicits. None of these will be mentioned, but it is safe to assume that these rules will alwyas hold up. For example, the acceleration in the vertical direction will be -9.8. Also, since the speed is constant in the horizontal direction, the acceleration in the horizontal direction will be zero. You will often have to deduce more information from the prompt. For example, if a question asks how far a projectile will have traveled horizontally when at the peak of its trajectory, you can assume the final velocity in the vertical direction is zero, as that is when a projectile is at its peak. You would first solve for time, because time is the only variable that relates the horizontal and vertical components together. Once you have time, you can find horizontal displacement by multiplying time by horizontal velocity.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>When solving projectile motion problems, make two equations: one for the horizontal direction, and one for the vertical direction. For the horizontal equation, you will always use the principle that distance is equal to velocity times time. A general rule for solving projectile motion problems follows.

<ul><span style="color:#FF0000;">1. Break down the initial velocity into horizontal and vertical components, using the sine and cosine.<br /><br />
	2. List the variables we have in the vertical direction. For example: acceleration (-9.8 meters per second squared), initial velocity, etc.<br /><br />
	3. Use the equation that relates the given variables to the variable time<br /><br />
	4. If necessary, multiply time by horizontal velocity to find horizontal displacement. This will not always be necessary, depending on the question.<br />

</ul>

<p>A pitcher throws a ball with an initial velocity of 40 meters per second, 45 degrees up relative to the ground. If the pitcher is two meters tall, how long will it take for the ball to hit the ground. 

<ul><span style="color:#008800;">1. We know that the angle is 45 degrees, and the net initial velocity is 40 meters per second. Therefore, we can break it up into horizontal and vertical velocity components. Using the equation above, 40 * cos(45) = 21 meters per second horizontally. Likewise, 40 * sin(45) = 21 meters per second vertically.<br /><br />

<img src="images/pmg4.png">

	2. The variabes we have in the vertical direction are initial velocity (21 meters per second), acceleration (-9.8 meters per second squared), and displacement. The question asks when the ball hits the ground, and since the pitcher is 5 feet tall, this will occur when the ball is displaced negative two meters.<br /><br />
	3. The equation that relates initial velocity, displacement, acceleration, and time is the third equation. Plugging in the values and solving will give you that time = 4.38 seconds. <br /><br />
	4. Though this question does not ask for it, if you wanted to find horizontal displacement (how far it traveled during its path), you would simply multiply the time by the horizontal velocity. 4.38 x 21 = 92.0 meters.<br />

<ul><i><b>8. (Challenge)</b></i> Two cars line up for a race. The gun goes off, and one shoots off from the start with an initial speed of 20 meters per second. The other car starts at rest, but accelerates slowly, at a steady 2 meters per second. How long (in seconds) will it take for the accelerating car to pass the nonaccelerating car? How far away from the starting point will this happen?</ul>


<h3>Practice Answers</h3>

<ul>1. <br />
	<b>Both will hit the ground with the same final velocity<br /></b>
	To verify this, we can plug in arbitrary variables to the kinematic equations. We have the displacement (d), initial velocity (positive and negative v), and since this is a freefall problem, we know each ball has the same acceleration (a = -9.8). We're trying to find final velocity, so we need to find an equation that relates displacement, initial and final velocity, and acceleration. The fourth kinematic equation satisfies this parameter. You'll notice that the initial velocity term is squared, which cancels out the negative sign, verifying that a positive or negative initial velocity will yield the same result.
</ul>
<ul>2. <br />
	<b>Upwards: negative acceleration<br />
	Peak: negative acceleration<br />
	Downwards: negative acceleration<br /></b>
	At every point in time, a ball in freefall will be accelerating downwards, or negatively. On its way up, its speed is decreasing, meaning that the acceleration acts in the opposite direction of the motion. On the way down, the speed is increasing, which means that the acceleration acts in the same direction of the motion. Its a bit trickier to conceptualize when the ball is at its peak, but remember that an object with zero velocity can have nonzero acceleration. Even though it is not moving at that point in time, its velocity will be negative in the next instance, so it <i>does</i> have a change in velocity (which is an acceleration).

	4. Plugging in <span style ="color:#FF0000;">vi = 6, vf = 8, and t = 2, </span>gives you <span style ="color:#000000;">d = 18 meters</span><br />
</ul>

<ul>8. <br />
	<b>Time: 20 seconds<br /></b>
	<b>Displacement: 400 meters</b><br />
	This is a bit harder to solve, so let's draw a schematic diagram to orient ourselves to the problem. We know that the first car (the one not accelerating) will have a final velocity of 20 meters per second, as it does not accelerate. We do not know the final velocity of the accelerating car.
</ul>

<img src="images/kinematics3.png">

<ul>
	We don't know the time or displacement, but we know that the time of car one will be the same as the time for car two, and likewise for displacement. This is implied, since the question asks us when they overlap. Technically, we now have four known variables: initial velocity, acceleration, displacement, and time. If we look for a kinematic equation that contains these four variables, we see that equation #3 fulfills this requirement. Now, we will make two seperate equations, one for each car, and solve.
</ul>

<img src="images/kinematics4.png">

<ul>
	Now that we have the time, we can plug this back into either of the equations from the picture. Both will yield 400 meters.
