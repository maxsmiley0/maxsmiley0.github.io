	<h1>Newton's Laws</h1>
</div>

<p>Last lesson, we talked about what force is, and some types of forces. Newton's First Law states that the velocity of an object will remain unchanged, unless an outside force acts on it. Therefore, since a force causes a change in velocity, a force causes an acceleration. Newton's Second Law tells us how to quantify this acceleration.</p>

</div>

<p>Newton realized that the acceleration due to a force is dependant on two things: that object's <span style ="color:#8900D3;">mass</span>, and the magnitude of the <span style ="color:#FF8800;">force</span> applied on that mass. Let's look at each individually. </p>

<h2><span style="color:#FF8800;">Force applied</span></h2>

<p>Question: What happens to the acceleration when we apply different amounts of <span style ="color:#FF8800;">force?</span>

<div id = "blurb">
<p><i>This interactive program illustrates how acceleration relates to <span style="color:#FF8800;">force</span>. Click on the window, then use the arrow keys to apply a force on the circle. The slider in the top right allows you to adjust the amount of force applied. See how variable amounts of force affect the acceleration.</i></p>
</div>

<canvas data-processing-sources="widgets/newtons_second_lawF.pde"></canvas>

<p>It seems as if the more <span style ="color:#FF8800;">force</span> applied, the greater the acceleration! Mathematically, we can say that acceleration is propotional to <span style ="color:#FF8800;">force.</span>

<img src="images/newtons_second_law1.png">

<p>Let's say an object accelerates at 10 meters per second when a two Newton force is applied. That means it will accelerate at 20 meters per second if four Newtons are applied. Likewise, it will only accelerate at 5 meters per second if one Newton is applied.</span>

<h2><span style="color:#8900D3;">Mass of Object</span></h2>

<p>Question: What happens to the acceleration when we change the <span style ="color:#8900D3;">mass</span> of an object?</p>

<div id = "blurb">
<p><i>This interactive program illustrates how acceleration relates to <span style="color:#8900D3;">mass</span>. Click on the window, then use the arrow keys to apply a force on the circle. The slider in the top right allows you to adjust the mass of the object. See how variable amounts of mass affect the acceleration.</i></p>
</div>

<canvas data-processing-sources="widgets/newtons_second_lawD.pde"></canvas>

<p>It seems as if the greater the <span style="color:#8900D3;">mass</span>, the less the acceleration! In other words, as the mass increases, the acceleration decreases. Mathematically, we can say that acceleration is inversely propotional to <span style="color:#8900D3;">mass.</span>

<img src="images/newtons_second_law2.png">

<p>Let's say an object accelerates at 10 meters per second, and is 2 kilograms. That means it will accelerate at only 5 meters per second if it were four kilograms, given the same force was being applied. Likewise, it will accelerate 20 meters per second if it were only one kilogram, given the same force was being applied.</span>

<h2>Unifying <span style ="color:#8900D3;">Mass</span> and <span style ="color:#FF8800;">Force</span></span></h2>

<div id = "blurb">
<p><i>This interactive program illustrates how acceleration relates to <span style="color:#8900D3;">mass</span> and <span style ="color:#FF8800;">force</span>.

<canvas data-processing-sources="widgets/newtons_second_law.pde"></canvas>

<p>We know that <span style ="color:#FF8800;">force</span> is directly proportional to acceleration, and that <span style="color:#8900D3;">mass</span>, is inversely proporitional to acceleration. We can combine these two statements to say that acceleration is <i>equal</i> to the force applied, divided by the total mass.

<h3>Practice Problems</h3>

<ul>1. You push your friend over. Was this a contact force, or a field force?</ul>
<ul>2. You let go of an orange, and it falls to the floor. Was this a contact force, or a field force?</ul>
<ul>3. You rub a balloon on your head, and your hair sticks to the balloon. Is it sticking to your head due to a contact force, or a field force?</ul>
<ul>4. You blow on a marble, and it rolls slowly. Did you exert a contact or field force on the marble?</ul>
<ul>5. A meteor is traveling in deep space at 500 meters per second. How fast will it be going in one year?</ul>
<ul>6. Is it possible for a force to be applied in one direction, while the object moves in the opposite direction?</ul>
<ul>7. If an 8 newton force is applied on an object with a mass of one kilogram, at what rate will the object accelerate?</ul>
<ul>8. Is force a vector or a scalar?</ul>
<ul><i><b>9. (Challenge)</b></i> If a 10 newton force is applied to an object with a mass of one kilogram, how long will it take until that object is traveling at 40 meters per second?</ul>


<h3>Practice Answers</h3>

<ul>1. <br />
	<b>Contact Force<br /></b>
	You come in contact with the object (your friend), so it is a contact force.
</ul>
<ul>2. <br />
	<b>Field Force<br /></b>
	Gravity is acting upon the orange, and the force of gravity is a considered a "field force".
</ul>
<ul>3. <br />
	<b>Field Force<br /></b>
	The balloon sticks to your head due to a difference in electrical charge, which occurred when you rubbed it against your head. Electricity/electromagnetism is considered a field force.
</ul>
<ul>4. <br />
	<b>Contact Force<br /></b>
	Although you don't directly come into contact with the marble, the air molecules from your breath are responsible for moving it. Your breath is not considered a field. Typically, gravity and electromagnetism will be the only fields you'll have to deal with.
</ul>
<ul>5. <br />
	<b>500 meters per second<br /></b>
	Newton's first law states that an object in motion will stay in motion, unless acted upon by an outside force. In deep space, the meteor would be free from any forces, like gravity or humans. Thus, its velocity won't change after a year.
</ul>
<ul>6. <br />
	<b>Yes<br /></b>
	A force only means that a push is being exerted in that direction. It dictates what direction the object is accelerating in. We know objects with positive velocities can have negative accelerations. One exampleis when you throw a ball up. Its velocity may be pointing upwards, but it is accelerating downwards due to gravity.
</ul>

<ul>7. <br />
	<b>8 meters per second squared<br /></b>
	This is the definition of one Newton. One Newton is the force required to accelerate one kilogram at one meter per second squared, so 8 Newtons is the force required to accelerate one kilogram at 8 meters per second squared. 
</ul>
<ul>8. <br />
	<b>Vector<br /></b>
	Force has a magnitude and a direction, so it is a vector.
</ul>
<ul>9. <br />
	<b>4 seconds<br /></b>
	Recall that 10 Newtons means that an object with a mass of one kilogram will accelerate at 10 meters per second squared. Thus, at this rate, it will reach 40 seconds after 4 seconds.
</ul>
