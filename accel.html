	<h1>Mechanics</h1>
</div>

<p>
	We've learned that <span style="color:#FF0000;">displacement</span> is the distance from the starting point to the ending point. We've learned that <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span> is the rate at which <span style="color:#FF0000;">displacement</span> changes with respect to time, or that it can simply be found by dividing <span style="color:#FF0000;">displacement</span> by time. <span style="color:#FF0000;">Acceleration</span> will be the focus of this lesson, and it respresents how <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span> changes with respect to time.
</p>
</div>

<h2><span style="color:#FF0000;">Acceleration</span></h2>

<p>Thus far, we have only been dealing with non<span style="color:#FF0000;">accelerated</span> motion. This is motion where the <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span> stays constant. However, in real life, rarely anything in motion stays at a constant <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span>. For example, when you jump, you fall faster and faster after each second that has gone by. The mathematical relationship between <span style="color:#FF0000;">acceleration</span>, <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span>, and time is represented by</p>

<img src="images/accel1.png">

<p>Let's say that racecar driver starts off with an initial <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span> of -66.22 meters per second. He <span style="color:#FF0000;">accelerates</span> to 0 meters per second in two seconds. We can find his average <span style="color:#FF0000;">acceleration</span>, because we know the initial <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span> (-66.22), the final <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span> (0), and the time (2).
<br /><br /><br />

<img src="images/accel2.png">

<p>Notice how the units for <span style="color:#FF0000;">acceleration</span> are meters per second squared. This can be confusing to interpret, but imagine that it represents "one meter per second per second." In other words, 33.11 meters per second squared means that after each second that passes, the <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span> increases by 33.11 meters per second.</p>

<h2>Direction of <span style="color:#FF0000;">Acceleration</span></h2>

<p>
	Like <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span>, <span style="color:#FF0000;">acceleration</span> is a <span style="color:#FF0000;">vector</span>. This means that the direction matters. This can be visualized by defining <span style="color:#FF0000;">acceleration</span> as something you can feel. Whenever you feel a push or a pull, you are being <span style="color:#FF0000;">accelerated</span>. Imagine that you're in a car. There are three means of <span style="color:#FF0000;">acceleration</span> in a car: the gas pedal, the brake pedal, and the steering wheel. It's obvious that you can be <span style="color:#FF0000;">accelerated</span> with a gas pedal; while you press on it, your <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span> will increase. While pressing this pedal, you feel yourself being pushed into the back of the car seat. While using the brake pedal, you "<span style="color:#FF0000;">decelerate</span>". This is also <span style="color:#FF0000;">accelerated</span> motion, it is <i>negative</i> <span style="color:#FF0000;">acceleration</span>. As you press the brake pedal, you feel yourself being thrust forward. The least intuitive means of <span style="color:#FF0000;">accelerating</span> is by using the steering wheel. If you round a corner at a constant 10 meters per second, it would seem that the <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span> doens't change. However, it does, because <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span> is <span style="color:#009900;">speed</span> <i>with direction</i>. While using the steering wheel, you are turning, therefore changing the direction. If you've ever taken a sharp corner without slowing down, you've felt the <span style="color:#FF0000;">acceleration</span> (when you were thrust into the side of the car), even though your <span style="color:#009900;">speed</span> didn't change at all.
</p>
<div id = "blurb"><ul><u>To summarize, acceleration is a change in velocity. There are three ways to achieve this.</ul></u>
<li>Gas Pedal: Change in velocity by increasing velocity</li>
<li>Brake Pedal: Change in velocity by decreasing velocity</li>
<li>Steering Wheel: Change in velocity by changing direction</li>

<p><i>This interactive program allows you to see the relationship between <span style="color:#FF0000;">velocity</span> and <span style="color:#FF0000;">acceleration</span>. Click on the window, and use the left and right arrow keys to <span style="color:#FF0000;">accelerate</span> the ball. When the right key is held down, the ball will be <span style="color:#FF0000;">accelerated</span> in the positive direction. When the left key is held down, the ball will <span style="color:#FF0000;">accelerate</span> in the negative direction.

<h3>Practice Problems</h3>

<h3>Practice Answers</h3>

<ul>1. <br />
	<b>Acceleration: 5 meters per second squared<br /></b>
	The prompt tells us that the runner starts from rest, so his initial velocity is 0. He gets up to 20 meters per second, so that is his final velocity. The time it takes for this to be achieved is 4 seconds. Plugging this into our formula, we get (20 - 0)/4 = 5 meters per second squared.
</ul>
<ul>2. <br />
	<b>Acceleration: 20,000,000 meters per second squared.<br /></b>
	The initial velocity is -100,000,000 meters per second, and the final velocity is 100,000,000 meters per second. The time taken is 10 seconds. Plugging this into our formula, we get (100,000,000 - (-100,000,000))/10 = 20,000,000 meters per second squared.
</ul>
<ul>3. <br />
	<b>Time: 3 seonds<br /></b>
	You're given 10 meters per second as the initial velocity, and want to find the time it takes to get to the hghest point. The key realization is that the velocity is 0 at the highest point. Plugging this into the equation gives you -10 = (0 - 30)/t, or t = 3.
	
</ul>
<ul>4. <br />
	<b>It is possible</b><br />
	This would mean that the ball is traveling to the right, but getting slower and slower with each passing second.
</ul>
<ul>5. <br />
	<b>It is possible</b><br />
	This would mean that the ball is traveling to the left, but getting slower and slower with each passing second.
</ul>
<ul>6. <br />
	<b>False</b><br />
	If an object is not accelerating, that simply means its motion is not changing. If a car were traveling at a constant 60 miles per hour, its acceleration would be zero.
</ul>

<ul>7. <br />
	<b>False</b><br />
	This is tricky, but think of a ball being thrown up in the air. It has some positive velocity on its way up, and some negative velocity on its way down. Because velocity vs time graphs are continuous, there has to be some point where the velocity is zero, which means that the object is at rest.
</ul>

<ul>8. <br />
	<b>Distance: 45 meters</b><br />
	We're given that the car starts from rest, and is accelerated uniformly at 10 meters per second squared for three seconds. Using the equation given in this lesson, we can find the final velocity to be 30 meters per second. 
	<br />
	<br />
	
</ul>

<img src="images/accel4.png">

<ul>From last lesson, we learned that average velocity is displacement over time. We want to find displacement, so displacement equals average velocity times time. We know the initial velocity and the final velocity, so the average velocity is the average of the two, or 15 meters per second. Multiply average velocity by time to get displacement.</ul>

<ul><b>Note we can only assume the average velocity is an average of the initial and final velocities because the acceleration is uniform</b></ul>
