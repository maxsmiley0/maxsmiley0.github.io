	<h1>Newton's Laws</h1>
</div>

<img src="images/newtons_first_law1.png">

<p>Sir Isaac Newton was born on Christmas, 1642. He's often thought of as the most influential physicist in history. In 1687, he published "Principia", laying down the foundations of classical mechanics, and is also accredited to have discovered calculus. We're going to be looking at some of his contributions to classical mechanics, starting with the introduction of a new concept, "Force".</p>
</div>

<h2><span style="color:#000000;">Force</span></h2>

<p>At its core, a <span style="color:#FF0000;">force</span> is a <span style="color:#FF0000;">push</span> or a <span style="color:#FF0000;">pull.</span> When you <span style="color:#FF0000;">throw</span> a ball, you're exerting a <span style="color:#FF0000;">force</span> on the ball. When you <span style="color:#FF0000;">push</span> a box, you're exerting a <span style="color:#FF0000;">force</span> on the box. We talk about <span style="color:#FF0000;">forces</span> as being <span style="color:#FF0000;">contact forces</span>, or <span style="color:#FF0000;">field forces. Contact forces</span> include those in which <span style="color:#FF0000;">forces</span> are exerted by contact, like <span style="color:#FF0000;">pushing, tugging</span>, etc. <span style="color:#FF0000;">Field forces</span> are those that appear to act without any contact, like <span style="color:#FF0000;">gravity</span>, or the <span style="color:#FF0000;">electromagnetic repulsion or attraction of charged particles.</span> <b>When a <span style="color:#FF0000;">force</span> is applied, <span style="color:#FF0000;">acceleration</span> will occur.</b> The units of <span style="color:#FF0000;">force</span> are measured in <span style="color:#FF0000;">"Newtons"</span>, named after Sir Isaac Newton, and abbreviated as <span style="color:#FF0000;">"N".</span> One <span style="color:#FF0000;">newton</span> is equivalent to one kilogram meter per second squared. This sounds confusing, but visualize this: one <span style="color:#FF0000;">newton</span> is equal to the <span style="color:#FF0000;">force</span> required to <span style="color:#FF0000;">accelerate</span> one kilogram of mass at one meter per second squared. Likewise, <span style="color:#FF0000;">10 newtons</span> is the amount of <span style="color:#FF0000;">force</span> required to <span style="color:#FF0000;">accelerate</span> one kilogram of mass at ten meters per second squared. </p>

<h2><span style="color:#000000;">Newton's First Law</span></h2>

<p>In essence, Newton's First Law states that an object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by an outside force. Intuitively this makes sense, an object at rest won't just suddently accelerate in some direction. </p>
<p>
What is less easy to grasp, is the fact that if an object is in motion, it will continue to stay in motion forever, unless acted upon by some force. This is weird, because if you roll a ball on earth, it will obviously stop at some point, which seems to contradict Newton's First Law. In fact, there is a force acting on it, the friction of the ground. </p>

<div id = "blurb">
<p><i>This interactive program illustrates <span style="color:#FF0000;">force</span>. <span style="color:#19b73e;">Click on the window</span>, and use the arrow keys to apply a force on the circle. A right arrow means a right force is being applied, an up force means an upward force is being applied, etc.</i></p>

<h3>Practice Problems</h3>

<ul>1. You push your friend over. Was this a contact force, or a field force?</ul>
<ul>2. You let go of an orange, and it falls to the floor. Was this a contact force, or a field force?</ul>
<ul>3. You rub a balloon on your head, and your hair sticks to the balloon. Is it sticking to your head due to a contact force, or a field force?</ul>
<ul>4. You blow on a marble, and it rolls slowly. Did you exert a contact or field force on the marble?</ul>
<ul>5. A meteor is traveling in deep space at 500 meters per second. How fast will it be going in one year?</ul>
<ul>6. Is it possible for a force to be applied in one direction, while the object moves in the opposite direction?</ul>
<ul>7. If an 8 newton force is applied on an object with a mass of one kilogram, at what rate will the object accelerate?</ul>
<ul>8. Is force a vector or a scalar?</ul>
<ul><i><b>9. (Challenge)</b></i> If a 10 newton force is applied to an object with a mass of one kilogram, how long will it take until that object is traveling at 40 meters per second?</ul>


<h3>Practice Answers</h3>

<ul>1. <br />
	<b>Contact Force<br /></b>
	You come in contact with the object (your friend), so it is a contact force.
</ul>
<ul>2. <br />
	<b>Field Force<br /></b>
	Gravity is acting upon the orange, and the force of gravity is a considered a "field force".
</ul>
<ul>3. <br />
	<b>Field Force<br /></b>
	The balloon sticks to your head due to a difference in electrical charge, which occurred when you rubbed it against your head. Electricity/electromagnetism is considered a field force.
</ul>
<ul>4. <br />
	<b>Contact Force<br /></b>
	Although you don't directly come into contact with the marble, the air molecules from your breath are responsible for moving it. Your breath is not considered a field. Typically, gravity and electromagnetism will be the only fields you'll have to deal with.
</ul>
<ul>5. <br />
	<b>500 meters per second<br /></b>
	Newton's first law states that an object in motion will stay in motion, unless acted upon by an outside force. In deep space, the meteor would be free from any forces, like gravity or humans. Thus, its velocity won't change after a year.
</ul>
<ul>6. <br />
	<b>Yes<br /></b>
	A force only means that a push is being exerted in that direction. It dictates what direction the object is accelerating in. We know objects with positive velocities can have negative accelerations. One exampleis when you throw a ball up. Its velocity may be pointing upwards, but it is accelerating downwards due to gravity.
</ul>

<ul>7. <br />
	<b>8 meters per second squared<br /></b>
	This is the definition of one Newton. One Newton is the force required to accelerate one kilogram at one meter per second squared, so 8 Newtons is the force required to accelerate one kilogram at 8 meters per second squared. 
</ul>
<ul>8. <br />
	<b>Vector<br /></b>
	Force has a magnitude and a direction, so it is a vector.
</ul>
<ul>9. <br />
	<b>4 seconds<br /></b>
	Recall that 10 Newtons means that an object with a mass of one kilogram will accelerate at 10 meters per second squared. Thus, at this rate, it will reach 40 seconds after 4 seconds.
</ul>
